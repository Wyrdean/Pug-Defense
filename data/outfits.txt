	description "The workings of the jump drive are a total mystery, to humans at least. The best that human scientists have been able to find out is that this device is a containment field for matter in a state that cannot normally exist in this universe; if the drive is opened up, the field collapses and its contents disappear. Therefore, even though a few jump drives have been captured over the years, it has so far proved impossible to reverse engineer them, for humans. More advanced aliens though seem to have had no issue in developing both a stronger albeit less efficent jump drive."
